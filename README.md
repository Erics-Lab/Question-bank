# Question-bank
# Motivation
I'm a computer science student. I've been learning about topics relevant to algorithms and do questions sometimes. But, I haven't made up my mind to (re)organize things until I recently realized that I need order and trackable record to perpetuate my study. Of course, Github provides a perfect place for me to store, organize, and share this stuff for free. So the thing is settled. In the long run, I would like this repository to be a collection of algorithm questions (and possibly other types of computer-science-related questions) that are interesting or significant. Feel free to propose a file change if you found any errors.

# Risk: If you want to copy the code for your assignment...
Please note that I'm not a professional in computer science or programming. I'm glad that my resources can help you, but if there's an error that both you and I overlooked, don't blame me for that.

# Where the questions come from?
I'm seldom on LeetCode, and the questions I answered may not be coming from there. Rather, I would describe myself as a scavenger wandering in different mini-blogs or books for interesting questions, questions of which may be originated from LeetCode (and other similiar websites).
